You need wait for about 5 min to see the figures (depend on how fast your computer is). The data were sampled with 100hz (a little high).  You can see the results corresponding to the Carsim data. This is just for you to check out the results.  I need some time to finalize it in order to make it readable. Maybe I can resend you a minimized version later this week.
